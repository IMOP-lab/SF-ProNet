Spectral-Spatial Modulation and Nonlinear Relational Projection for Multi-Scale Morphological Delineation Enhancing in Complex OCT Macular Pathologies


## Installation

Initial learning rates are uniformly set at 0.0001, with batch sizes standardized to 2 across all models.The experiments are conducted on a computational platform equipped with dual NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super GPUs. The software environment comprises Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.4.0, and CUDA 12.1.  All training and evaluations are executed under consistent hardware and software configurations to ensure reproducibility and fairness.
