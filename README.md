Structural depiction of the SF-ProNet, comprising an encoding branch bifurcated into a spatial-domain encoder and a wavelet transform-based low-frequency feature extraction pathway, interconnected via iSpaGate facilitating selective spectral-spatial fusion; a bottleneck stage characterized by dual consecutive FluFormer module designed for simultaneous global-local feature modeling; and a decoding branch structured by four successive upsampling processes, each followed by a eLARE graph dynamically refining inter-channel dependencies to enhance granularity of reconstructed segmentation features.

The schematic representation illustrates the proposed iSpaGate, wherein spatial-domain input features and low-frequency components de-rived via discrete wavelet transformation are concurrently utilized; the low-frequency spectrum is subjected to convolutional processing and nonlinear activation to produce a spatial attention map, subsequently modulating the spatial-domain representation through element-wise multiplication, and further adaptively integrated through trainable parameters, resulting in refined output features via multiplication with the original spatial-domain input.

</p>

The schematic depiction of the proposed FluFormer architecture, wherein the input features undergo spatial encoding independently along the x, y, and z spatial dimensions, incorporated into the feature embedding space; encoded representations are concurrently propagated through parallel multi-head self-attention and convolutions for global and localized feature extraction, respectively, followed by a fusion mechanism facilitating cross-branch integration. Moreover, the feedforward pathway integrates KAN layers to augment nonlinear representational capacity, enhancing the expressiveness of higher-order interactions inherent in complex pathological structures.

The proposed eLARE graph, by computing spatially aggregated mean vectors across each channel and dynamically constructing an inter-channel similarity graph to effectively capture cross-channel correlations, integrates graph convolution and dynamic channel modeling strategies, thereby facilitating enhanced feature representation and detailed spatial recovery in OCT segmentation tasks.
